RaspiFM
=======

Python script for playing multiple files with the common C RaspiFM (pifm) bits.

Get the C code and bits will be the bits from:
http://www.icrobotics.co.uk/wiki/index.php/Turning_the_Raspberry_Pi_Into_an_FM_Transmitter

The Python code will be my own, since everyone else seems to think it is sufficient to play one file.
